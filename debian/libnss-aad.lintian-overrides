# The versioned library is the actual library itself, there is no link to it.
libnss-aad: lacks-versioned-link-to-shared-library

# cargo build currently does not support changing the output name of libraries and the functionality
# is still being tracked at https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9778. Therefore, we must build
# it with the base name (i.e. libnss_aad.so) and then manually rename it to contain the version, as
# done in the dh_auto_install step.
# With this approach, libnss is not using soname to track compatibility, so this override is safe.
