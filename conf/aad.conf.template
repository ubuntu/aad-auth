### required values
## See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal
## for more information on how to set up an Azure AD app.
# tenant_id = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
# app_id = yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy

### optional values (defaults)
# offline_credentials_expiration = 90 ; duration in days a user can log in without online verification
                                      ; set to 0 to prevent old users from being cleaned and allow offline authentication for an undetermined amount of time
                                      ; set to a negative value to prevent offline authentication
# homedir = /home/%f ; home directory pattern for the user, the following mapping applies:
#                    ; %f - full username
#                    ; %U - UID
#                    ; %l - first char of username
#                    ; %u - username without domain
#                    ; %d - domain
# shell = /bin/bash ; default shell for the user

## UID range configuration
## WARNING! Changing these values may effect existing users.
min_uid = 100000 ; minimum UID to assign (inclusive)
max_uid = 2147483647 ; maximum UID to assign (exclusive)
                     ; the default max_uid is 4294967295 (max uint32), however this causes issues with commonly used software, such as xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
                     ; this value (max int32) works with most software, while still providing a large UID space.

### overriding values for a specific domain, every value inside a section is optional
# [domain.com]
# tenant_id = aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
# app_id = bbbbbbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbbbbbbbbbb
# offline_credentials_expiration = 30
# homedir = /home/domain.com/%u
# shell = /bin/zsh
